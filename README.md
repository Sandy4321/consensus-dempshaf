# Dempster-Shafer model for multi-agent consensus

This is a version of the kind of consensus model developed during my Ph.D. in which agents broadcast their beliefs to the surrounding, listening agents, who update their beliefs based on the broadcast. Specifically, this is a voter-type model set in the context of the best-of-n problem. In this model, beliefs are not three-valued w/ imprecise probability, but instead are represented in Dempster-Shafer's theory of evidence.

Looking at evidence-based dissemination in combination with consensus to see if a Dempster-Shafer model can converge with either completely ignorant beliefs, or uniformly distributed beliefs, to the best-of-n.
